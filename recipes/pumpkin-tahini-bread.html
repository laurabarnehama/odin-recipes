    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Rich, dense and flavorful pumpkin bread is topped with a spiced cream cheese glaze for the perfect breakfast on a crisp Fall morning. Pair with coffee or enjoy as a sweet treat. It’s better than anything store-bought and made with better ingredients!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>3 Tbsp pumpkin pie spice</li>
        <li>¾ tsp sea salt</li>
        <li>1 tsp baking soda</li>
        <li>2 eggs or vegan substitute</li>
        <li>¾ cup pumpkin puree</li>
        <li>1 cup maple syrup</li>
        <li>½ cup Soom Premium or Organic Tahini</li>
        <li>¼ cup butter or coconut oil, melted and cooled</li>
        <li>Optional add-ins: chopped walnuts, pumpkin seeds, chocolate chips</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350℉. Line a loaf pan with parchment paper and set aside.</li>
        <li>In a small mixing bowl, combine all-purpose flour, spices, and baking soda.</li>
        <li>In a separate large bowl, whisk the eggs, pumpkin puree, maple syrup, tahini, and melted butter to create a thick glaze. Add the dry ingredients to the wet and mix with a wooden spoon until a batter forms. Fold in optional add-ins if desired.</li>
        <li>Spread batter evenly in the loaf pan and bake for 45-55 minutes, until a knife comes out clean. ***Since every oven is different, check your loaf at 45 minutes then every 5 minutes after, being careful not to overbake.</li>
        <li>Remove bread from the oven and allow to cool in the pan for at least 15 minutes, then turn out onto cool on a cooling rack. Slice the bread and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
