    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Raise your hand if Reese’s peanut butter cups are your favorite candy; it’s been mine since I was a little girl. I remember finding my Dad’s stash of peanut butter cups in the fridge or freezer and begging him to have one after dinner. It’s funny, I even remember eating the edges of the peanut butter cup and then savoring the peanut butter middle for last.</p>
    <p>These days, I make my own homemade healthy peanut butter cups, and still am obsessed with just about anything with a peanut butter and chocolate combo. That’s exactly where these chocolate peanut butter protein bars come in. They provide a healthy dose of protein, yet they taste like dessert. WIN WIN WIN.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>¾ cup natural creamy peanut butter (just peanuts + salt)</li>
        <li>¼ cup honey (or coconut palm syrup, if vegan)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon melted coconut oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla</li>
        <li>⅓ cup ground flaxseed meal</li>
        <li>½ cup of your favorite vanilla or plain protein powder</li>
        <li>2.5 ounces your favorite 85% dark chocolate bar</li>
        <li>Coarse sea salt for sprinkling on top</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a medium bowl mix together peanut butter, honey, coconut oil, vanilla together until smooth. Add in ground flaxseed meal and protein powder of choice. Use a spoon to mix together until you can’t anymore, then use clean hands to help work together. The batter should be similar to cookie dough.</li>
        <li>Press into an 8x4 inch pan lined with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Make the chocolate layer by adding 2.5 ounces of dark chocolate to a small saucepan and melting until completely smooth. Pour the melted chocolate over the peanut butter layer and tilt the pan so that the chocolate covers the peanut butter layer entirely.</li>
        <li>Place in the fridge for 30 minutes-1 hour before slicing into 10 bars or squares (either works but I love squares the most). Store covered in the fridge until ready to eat. Bars will keep for up to two weeks.</li>
    </ol>
