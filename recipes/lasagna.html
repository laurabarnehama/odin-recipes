    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>12 lasagna noodles (regular, whole grain, gluten free, and no boil all work)</li>
        <li>1 tbsp extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>Optional veggies: 1 chopped zucchini, 8oz sliced mushrooms, 2 cups fresh spinach</li>
        <li>2-24oz jars marinara sauce (feel free to use less, but I like mine saucy!)</li>
        <li>1 batch tofu ricotta</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>

        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Press tofu (I like to do this ahead of time).Preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Press tofu (I like to do this ahead of time).</li>
        <li>If using no-boil noodles, proceed to step 3. If using noodles that need to be cooked, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. (A splash of olive oil helps prevent the noodles from sticking together!) Add noodles and cook just until al dente. Drain and set aside. I like to lay them out on a kitchen towel.</li>
        <li>While the noodles boil, cook the veggies. Heat oil over medium heat in a large skillet. Once hot, add zucchini and mushrooms plus a pinch of salt and pepper. Cook for 5 minutes, stirring often, until softened. Add spinach and sauté for another 3-5 minutes. Remove pan from heat.</li>

        <li>Add 1 heaping cup of marinara to the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish, spreading it evenly. Top with about 4 noodles (3 lengthwise and 1 widthwise to cover the gap at the end, depending on the size).</li>
        <li>Top evenly with half of the ricotta mixture and half of the vegetable mixture. Top with 1 ½ cups or more of sauce. Repeat with another layer of noodles, the rest of the tofu mixture, and remaining veggies.</li>
        <li>Top with one last layer of noodles and another 1 ½ cups or more of sauce. Top with a sprinkle of nutritional yeast.</li>
        <li>Cover dish with foil and bake for 30-35 minutes, or until noodles are softened. Oven times may vary depending on the noodles used. Let lasagna rest for 15 minutes before eating! Lasagna will keep in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.</li>
